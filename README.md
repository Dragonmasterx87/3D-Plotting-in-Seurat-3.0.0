# 3D-Plotting-in-Seurat

The following code is used to generate nice interactive 3D tSNE and UMAP plots against Seurat objects created using the excellent single cell RNAseq analysis tool created by the Satijalab. V1 works for Seurat v2.3.4 + v3.0.2 and V2 (better interactive graphics, uses RShiny) of the code works for Seurat v3.0.0-v3.1.1

The engine behind this code uses plotly:

# News:

Code for analyzing UMAP embeddings and plotting in 3D are now added. Compatible with integrated/combined datasets created using new and improved sample integration systems in Seurat.
